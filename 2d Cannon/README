Use up and down arrows to adjust the cannon angle.
Use left and right angle to adjust the cannon fire power.

In this project, I developed my own collision detection 
method to detect the collision between the cannon ball 
and the terrain or the collisions between cannon balls.

I used a midpoint bisection method to generate the terrain.

I used the verlet integration to implement the insects that
are flying on the left of the screen.
